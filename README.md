# APPLE Alias Resolution
APPLE uses a combination of common successor in traceroute and ping reply TTL to find router aliases.
Currently, the code only supports warts files generated by the scamper tool.

The first step is to input warts traceroute files to the traceparse.py script.
This generates a list of unique adjacencies, excluding those only seen in address loops, or where the second address is an ICMP Echo Reply.
You can optionally generate this list yourself with any traceroute files.
The format is two tab-separated addresses on each line.

The second step is to ping all addresses in the first column from many vantage points, using scamper.
Pass the resulting warts files to the apple.py script.
The default acceptance threshold (from the paper) is .78, but you can specify any value between 0 and 1. Higher numbers increase precision, possibly at the expense of recall.
The output is a list of inferred router nodes, in the same format as CAIDA ITDK nodes files.
